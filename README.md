Using Open Weather and Google Maps APIs and JSON to access and analyze weather data to examine how weather may change as one approaches the equator.


## **WeatherPy**
A list of >500 cities was created based on randomly generated longitude and latitude. Data for location coordinates, max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, country, and date of access was extracted and analyzed to examine trends based on distance from the equator. Scatterplots were created to examine how latitude (distance from the equator) effects max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. Linear regressions were performed for these parameters for cities both in the northern and southern hemispheres and correlation coefficients were calculated. 

### **Observations based on the data analysis**
